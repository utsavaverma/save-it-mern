# SaveIt

## Overview

A large population of people in developing countries such as India is unable to get enough food. According to a study, nearly 190mn Indians go hungry every day. Moreover, a lot of food is wasted every day in restaurants, hotels, and events such as weddings. There is a need for a digital platform that connects the two sides so that the food is not wasted and is instead distributed to those in need. 
Our team has developed a website prototype named ‘SaveIt’ to connect NGOs with restaurants and hotels so that the excess food is not wasted and rather distributed among the needy. The website will act as a medium that ensures that nobody goes to bed empty stomach. Additionally, food wastage can be distributed to industries that recycle organic waste or create other useful products, hence contributing to a sustainable environment.
